# Contributing

We will _consider_ any contributions that align with the stated goals of the
project.

## Legal
Any pull requests grant permission to use the submitted changes according to the terms of the project's license, and that the work being submitted is under appropriate copyright.

## Housekeeping
Your pull request should:

* Include a description of what your change intends to do.
* Be based on a reasonably recent commit in the `master` branch.
* Include tests covering your changes _as appropriate_.

## Be nice
We might be slower than you'd like. This is not our "day job". We might also ask you to make changes to the pull request. We ask for your patience. :smiley:
